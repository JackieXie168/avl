.Sh DESCRIPTION
If a node has moved to a different location in memory, you can repair
the AVL tree structure using this function.
This function will fail (segfault, probably) if other nodes have moved as well.
In other words, you can only move one node at once.
Returns immediately if the value of
.Ar node
or
.Ar tree
is
.Dv NULL .
It is safe to call this function on a node that has not been moved.
.Sh RETURN VALUES
Returns the previous location of this node or
.Dv NULL
if either of the arguments was
.Dv NULL .
.Sh ERRORS
This function does not affect the value of
.Dv errno .
