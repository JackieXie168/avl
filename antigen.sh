# An utility script to remove all generated files.
#
# Running autogen.sh will be required after running this script since
# the 'configure' script will also be removed.
#
# This script is mainly useful when testing autoconf/automake changes
# and as a part of their development process.
# If there's a Makefile, then run the 'distclean' target first (which
# will also remove the Makefile).
if test -f Makefile; then
  make distclean

# Remove all tar-files (assuming there are some packages).
rm -f *.tar.* *.tgz
# Also remove the autotools cache directory.
rm -Rf autom4te.cache
# Remove rest of the generated files.
