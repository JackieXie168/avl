Version 2.0.0 2011-04-05 Wessel Dankers <wsl@fruit.je>
	API change: names are now object-verb (conversion script included)
	Change build system to autofrob+libtool
	Add manpages

Version 0.3.5 2002-11-15 Wessel Dankers <wsl@fruit.eu.org>
	Added avl_node_fixup() and avl_clear_tree().
	Removed obsolete files from source tree.

Version 0.3.4 2002-06-11 Wessel Dankers <wsl@fruit.eu.org>
	Fixed a bug in the node counting.

Version 0.3.1 2001-07-17 Wessel Dankers <wsl@nl.linux.org>
	Node initialization is moved to make matters a bit more robust

Version 0.3.0 2001-01-07 Wessel Dankers <wsl@nl.linux.org>
	Tree can now be balanced on count or depth (but depth works better).
	Fixed bug: balancing on count now is done correctly.

Version 0.2.0 2000-11-28 Wessel Dankers <wsl@nl.linux.org>
	Modifications to support fast traversal and accessing by index.
	The tree is generalized to allow arbitrary comparison functions.
	Fixed bug: when deleting, in some cases rebalancing would not occur

Version 0.1.0 (alpha):
	This is the initial alpha version of AVLTree.  It's already fully
	functional for many applications, including the one that I developed it
	for.  I've only tested it on my Linux 2.0.35/glibc2 system, so I have no
	idea what it will do anywhere else so far.  Let me know if you have good
	results or bad if you try a platform that I don't mention above.

	This version is considered alpha because it does not yet contain
	all of the features that I plan for version 1.0.0.  It should not
	contain any bugs as it is.
